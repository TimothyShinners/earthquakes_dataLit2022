# A small attempt to create short term earthquake forecasts

This repo contains files that were sued for my Data Literacy project in winter semester 21/22. The EarthquakeForecastPaper.pdf is the four page paper that I created. PaperSourceFiles contains the .tex and .sty files needed to recreate the PDF. It also contains PDF files of the figures that were used in the paper, as well as the .tex file for my initial project proposal. The Code folder contains a .ipynb file, which is messy but it is the file that I used to conduct all of my analysis and create all my plots. It has a lot of extra stuff that didn't make it into the paper. In DataCleaning.py, I copy/pasted all of the code needed to create the data frames that were used in the plots in the paper. Then, I copy/pasted the code used to create plots into the the Fig-----.py files. If you want to recreate the plots, I would copy/paste the code from DataCleaning.py and whichever Fig-----.py file into the same file, then run it. Be careful though because there is a section of code that generates bootstrap samples in DataCleaning.py and it takes roughly an hour to run. I am still unfamiliar with GitHub, so I apologize if I failed to follow any GitHub conventions.
